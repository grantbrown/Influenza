Analyses of CDC Flu Data.
==========================

Research Goals: 
----------------

* Quantify the increase in susceptibility attributable to several novel flu strains.
* Evaluate single location and spatial prediction techniques.  
* Apply empirically adjusted reproductive number techniques to perform intensity process model selection. 
* Motivate simulations for the [libspatialSEIR](http://grantbrown.github.io/libSpatialSEIR) software project.
